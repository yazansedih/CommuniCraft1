## API Documentation

The API is fully documented using Postman. Access the documentation [here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/29528140/2s9YkuZyR9).

## Testing

#### Postman Testing Strategy

We have employed Postman for comprehensive API testing to ensure the functionality, reliability, and accuracy of the EcoTrack platform. Our testing strategy involves:

- **Automated Tests:** Writing automated test scripts within Postman to perform API endpoint testing, covering scenarios for data submission, user profile management, environmental alerts, community reporting, and more.
- **Environment Setup:** Configuring different environments within Postman to simulate various conditions and perform thorough testing.
- **Collection Runs:** Executing collection runs in Postman to validate endpoints, data validations, authentication mechanisms, and error handling.

**Instructions for Testing Using Postman:**

1. Import the provided Postman collection.
2. Set up the necessary environment variables, choose the *EcoTrack Env*.
3. Run collection tests individually or perform a collection run to test various API endpoints.
